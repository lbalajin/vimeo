Below are some of the possible test cases for Auto-Scaler solution.

A) Boundary Testing:
    1) Lower Bound: Test when CPU utilization is extremely low (e.g., 0.10) and ensure the auto-scaler doesn't decrease replicas below a minimum threshold.
    2) Upper Bound: Test when CPU utilization is very high (e.g., 0.95) and ensure the auto-scaler doesn't increase replicas excessively.

B) Threshold Testing:
    1) Vary CPU utilization around the target (e.g., 0.75, 0.80, 0.85) and verify if the auto-scaler adjusts replicas accordingly.
    2) Validate that the script logs INFO messages for successful replica count adjustments.

C) Stability Testing:
    1) Test the auto-scaler's behavior over a prolonged period, checking if it consistently adjusts replicas to maintain the desired CPU utilization average.
    2) Monitor the log file for stability, ensuring no critical errors are logged during prolonged operation.

D) Error Handling and Logging Validation:
    1) Simulate scenarios where API calls fail or return unexpected responses.
    2) Verify that the script logs ERROR messages for encountered errors during API interactions.
    3) Validate the content and format of log entries related to errors, successful events, and replica count changes.

E) Logging Format and Observability:
    1) Inspect the log file (autoscaler.log) for the recorded events, timestamps, and their respective logging levels (INFO and ERROR).
    2) Ensure the log file provides clear visibility into the script's behavior, including successful actions and encountered errors.

F) Load Testing and Log Analysis:
    1) Simulate sudden increases or decreases in load, monitoring the log file for the auto-scaler's response during these load changes.
    2) Analyze the log file to assess the auto-scaler's behavior, system stability, and how it handles load fluctuations.
